name=Temporal/Spectral Profile Tool
description=Plots profile from raster bands. Based on Profile Tool.
about =
	A QGIS plugin for interactive plotting of temporal or spectral information stored in multi-band rasters. Based on Profile tool plugin.

	After installation and activation the plugin can be accessed either from main menu (under Plugins > Profile Tool > Temporal/Spectral Profile) or from an icon on the taskbar.

	This plugin was initially developed under the TIGER-NET project (www.tiger-net.org) funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) and currently is part of GlobWetland Africa Toolbox (http://globwetland-africa.org) also funded by ESA. Copyright (C) 2020 DHI-GRAS A/S (http://www.dhi-gras.com).

    The plugin contains Python nc-time-axis package. See https://github.com/SciTools/nc-time-axis for license and details.

changelog=2.1.2
    - Read netCDF time dimension as standard Python datetime object. Avoids the use of nc_time_axis which is causing issues due to different versions of packages in different installations.
    2.1.1
    - Fix exception when raster layer does not have a projection
    2.1.0
    - Allow project (in case of point selection) or polygon to have different projection to raster layer
    2.0.3
    -   Import nc_time_axis only when matplotlib is available
    2.0.2
    - Add nc-time-axis to fix issues with dates in some netCDF files.
    - Fix bug which always reset axes when using timesteps
    - Allow y-axis range to be locked
    2.0.1
    - Fix handling of NaN values.
    2.0.0
    - Make compatible with QGIS 3.0.
    - Add functionality to plot point profiles without clicking.
    - Do not use the same colour for all newly added layers.
    1.2.2
    - Bug fixes
    1.2.1
    - Add option to set X-axis time steps from NetCDF time dimension.
    - Do not change matplotlib line styling unless axis also needs changing.
    - Bug fixes.
    1.2.0
    - Add option to set the x-axis steps based on raster band number, custom values or regular time-steps.
    1.1.3
    - Order zonal statistics by alphabetical order and set mean as the default
    - Fix exception when raster band has no scale and offset attributes
    1.1.2
	- Fix GDAL 2.x compatibility
	- Improved handling of removal of layers from map canvas
	1.1.1
	- Fix y-axis extent
	- Update code repository in metadata file
	1.1.0
	- Add option for plotting zonal statistics' temporal/spectral profiles
	- Small GUI adjustments to maintain the same look as Profile Tool
	- Bug fixes
	1.0.1
	- Update metadata.txt
